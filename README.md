## üß™ Testing

SlashRun includes a comprehensive pytest test suite that validates the economic simulation API functionality without requiring external services or a running application instance.

### Test Architecture

**Isolation & Independence**
- ‚úÖ **No Service Required**: Tests run independently without needing the API server to be running
- ‚úÖ **In-Memory Database**: Each test uses a clean SQLite in-memory database for complete isolation
- ‚úÖ **Mock External APIs**: No external API calls during testing - all data is mocked/simulated
- ‚úÖ **Fast Execution**: Complete test suite runs in seconds due to in-memory operations

**What the Tests Confirm**
- üîê **Authentication System**: JWT token generation, validation, and protected endpoint access
- üèõÔ∏è **Database Operations**: Model relationships, JSON state storage, audit trail persistence
- üìä **API Endpoints**: All CRUD operations, error handling, and response formats
- üåç **Economic Simulations**: Multi-country scenarios, policy impacts, and state transitions
- üéØ **Trigger System**: Policy patches, network rewrites, and event injection mechanisms
- üìà **Audit Transparency**: Complete field-level change tracking and historical state queries

### Test Data Sources

**Mock Economic Data**
- Realistic GDP, inflation, unemployment figures based on actual country data
- Historical trade relationships (US-China bilateral trade volumes)
- Monetary policy parameters (Taylor rule coefficients, policy rates)
- Financial crisis scenarios based on 2008-2009 and European debt crisis patterns

**Sample Fixtures**
```python
# Example: US-China trade scenario data
sample_mvs_state = {
    "countries": {
        "USA": {"gdp": 23000000, "inflation": 0.025, "policy_rate": 0.05},
        "CHN": {"gdp": 17700000, "inflation": 0.021, "policy_rate": 0.035}
    },
    "trade_matrix": {"USA": {"CHN": 120000}, "CHN": {"USA": 450000}}
}
```

### Test Configuration

**pytest.ini Options** (in pyproject.toml)
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["backend/tests"]
asyncio_mode = "auto"           # Automatic async test handling
addopts = ["-v", "--cov=backend/app", "--cov-report=html"]
markers = [
    "slow: marks tests as slow",
    "integration: marks tests as integration tests"
]
```

**Dependencies Required**
- `pytest>=7.4.0` - Test framework
- `pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0` - Async test support
- `pytest-cov>=4.1.0` - Coverage reporting
- `httpx` - HTTP client for API testing
