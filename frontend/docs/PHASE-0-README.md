- Gotham-inspired design tokens defined in `styles/tokens.css` alongside typography and layout modules.
- Workspace shell layout established with top bar, sidebar navigation, evidence rail, and timeline footer placeholders.
- Authentication scaffolding implemented via cookie-backed login/logout API routes and shared auth utilities.
- Client-side providers created for authentication state and UI toggles (sidebar/timeline).
- Baseline Storybook stories and Vitest suites configured for component development.
