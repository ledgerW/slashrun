# Phase 1 Implementation Notes

Phase 1 hardens authentication, introduces shared simulation state, and wires TanStack Query for scenario hydration across the workspace experience.

## Highlights

- Login flow upgraded to a React Hook Form client component that validates with Zod and submits through the `loginAction` server action. Inline errors, focus management, and toast notifications surface authentication failures while successful submissions trigger server-side redirects.
- Workspace layout now composes dedicated providers for authentication, TanStack Query, toasts, UI chrome, and a new `SimulationProvider` (Zustand) that tracks active scenarios and timeline metadata.
- Server-side workspace entry (`/(workspace)/page.tsx`) prefetches scenario summaries, seeds the query cache, and hydrates the simulation store for consistent dropdown and panel rendering.
- API helpers expanded to cover auth headers, simulation transforms, and server actions for login/logout, alongside Next.js route handlers for simulation listings.
- Edge middleware guards workspace routes by requiring the `slashrun_token` cookie while redirecting authenticated users away from `/login`.
- Documentation updated and Vitest suites added for the simulation store, login form behaviour, and existing workspace shell to match the new provider stack.
